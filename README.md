 # MonoGame Tetris

This is a very basic pong game where both paddles are controlled with the W/S and Up/Down keys on the keyboard. Made in C# using the monogame framework as a base.
This project was done as a personal, rapid prototyping challenge and completed in less than a day.

## gameplay notes
The speed of the ball and paddles increases with each collision, this in turn increases the players score. 
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the monogame framework installed on your computer, if not then the project will not run. In the future I may include a pre-compiled executable in the project that
testers may run without compiling.
